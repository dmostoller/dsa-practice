# Technical Assessment Tips: Smart Construction Equipment

## 1. Data Structures for IoT/Equipment
- **Understand queues and buffers** for sensor data streams
- **Know graph algorithms** for equipment location/relationship mapping
- **Practice real-time data processing** scenarios
- **Master time series data** handling

```javascript
// Example: Processing sensor readings
const sensorReadings = new Queue();
function processReading(reading) {
    if (reading > THRESHOLD) {
        alertOperator();
    }
}
```

## 2. System Design Considerations
- **Equipment failure handling** patterns
- **Latency management** between equipment and control systems
- **Offline vs online modes** design
- **Data synchronization** strategies

```python
def handle_connection_loss(equipment):
    # Store data locally
    local_cache.save(equipment.readings)
    # When connection restores
    sync_with_central_system()
```

## 3. Safety-Critical Programming
- **Input validation** best practices
- **Edge case handling** requirements
- **Fail-safe implementation** patterns
- **Operational limits** enforcement

```javascript
function adjustEquipmentSpeed(speed) {
    if (speed < MIN_SAFE_SPEED || speed > MAX_SAFE_SPEED) {
        return emergencyStop();
    }
    // Normal operation
}
```

## 4. Optimization and Performance
- **Real-time response** optimization
- **Concurrent operations** handling
- **Embedded system** memory constraints
- **Power usage** considerations

```python
# Example: Efficient sensor polling
def poll_sensors(sensors):
    # Batch readings to save power
    readings = [sensor.get_reading() for sensor in sensors]
    batch_transmit(readings)
```

## 5. Testing and Debugging
- **Hardware-dependent code** testing strategies
- **Hardware interface** simulation/mocking
- **Timing-related issues** debugging
- **Environmental factors** consideration

```javascript
test('emergency stop works when sensor fails', () => {
    const mockSensor = new MockSensor();
    mockSensor.simulateFailure();
    expect(safetySystem.status).toBe('EMERGENCY_STOP');
});
```

## Interview Strategy Tips
- Ask about specific hardware platforms
- Show interest in construction/industrial challenges
- Emphasize maintainability and reliability
- Discuss sensor data accuracy and calibration
- Consider real-world constraints (dust, vibration, weather)
- Focus on safety and fault tolerance
- Be ready to discuss real-time systems architecture
