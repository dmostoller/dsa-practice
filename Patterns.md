8 D-A Patterns
 
1. Two Pointer - useful to iterate through sorted arrays - 167 and 15 
2. Binary Tree BFS - breadth first search  (use a queue)-  102
3. Topological Search - useful for Directed Acyclic Graphs - prerequisites chains 207
4. Binary Tree DFS - depth first search (recursion) 104
5. Top K elements  â€” use a heap
6. Modified Binary Search - 33
